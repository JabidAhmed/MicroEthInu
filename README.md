### Steps To Change Code: (If you wish to)
1. Open the code on Vs Code Editor. (CMD/CTRL + O)<br>
2. Goto #1212 line and change the contract name (Usually according to the token name or symbol but can be anything in one word).<br>
3. #1228, 1229 & 1230 line for changing the reflection, liquidity & marketing (dev) fees.<br>
4. #1233 line is for the address where the marketing or dev fees will go. Change it as you want but canâ€™t be the same address as the owner (deployer).<br>
5. To change the name: <br>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78958410/131809969-6b20519d-3c7a-40e3-b286-478169c333b5.png) <br>
